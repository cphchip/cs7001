# Assignment 5.3
# Write a function to divide two integers, n1 and n2 as n1/n2
# function: divide (n1: int, n2:int) -> Any:
# If n2 is passed as zero, catch the exception, display "Can't divide by Zero" and return None as the value 
# of the function.
# Do not use if statements â€“ use Exceptions!
